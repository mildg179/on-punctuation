                    One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is the apostrophe for possession.
                    <br> 
                    <span class="largetext">Well<span class="redtext">,</span> feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that for many<span class="redtext">,</span> that for some the possessive case apostrophe 
                    has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it.</span>
                    <br>
                    One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                    and from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it and leaving it out I feel no
                    regret<span class="redtext">. <u>T</u></span>here it is<span class="redtext">,</span> unnecessary and not ornamental but inside a word and its <span class="redtext">“s”</span> well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal 
                    by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has 
                    come in and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time to time let it come in. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So now to come to the real question of punctuation<span class="redtext">;</span> periods, commas, colons, semi-colons and capitals and small letters.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have had a long and complicated life with all these.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Let us begin with these I use the least first<span class="redtext">,</span> and these are colons and semi-colons<span class="redtext">. <u>O</u></span>ne might add to these commas.
