                    What does a comma do<span class="redtext">?</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I have refused them so often and left the out so much and did without them so continually 
                    that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not, 
                    but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As I say<span class="redtext">,</span> commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, 
                    it is a way of replacing oneâ€™s own interest<span class="redtext">. <s>and</s></span> I do decidedly like to like my own interest 
                    <span class="redtext"><s>and</s>my own interest</span> in what I am doing. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="largetext">A comma<span class="redtext">,</span> by helping you along holding your 
                    coat for you and putting on your shoes<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                    keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                    and to me for many years <span class="redtext">-</span>and I still 
                    do feel that way about it<span class="redtext">-</span> only now I do not pay as much attention to them, the use of them was positively degrading.</span> 
                    <br>
                    Let me tell you what I feel<span class="redtext">, <s>and</s></span> what I mean<span class="redtext">, <s>and</s></span> what I felt<span class="redtext">, <s>and</s></span> what I meant.
