    <div class="thediv">
        You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon<span class="redtext">,</span> or a semi-colon.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons<span class="redtext">;</span> you can think of them as 
        commas and as such they are purely servile<span class="redtext">,</span> or you can think of them as periods and then using 
        them can make you feel adventurous<span class="redtext">.</span> I can see that one might feel about them as periods but I myself 
        never have, I began unfortunately to feel them as a comma, and commas are servile they have no 
        life of their own<span class="redtext">. <u>T</u></span>hey are dependent upon use and convenience and they are put there just for practical purposes. 
        <br>
        <span class="largetext">Semi-colons and colons had for me from the first completely<span class="redtext">,</span> this character<span class="redtext">,</span> the character that a 
        comma has and not the character that a period has<span class="redtext">,</span> and therefore and definitely I have never used them. 
        But<span class="redtext">,</span> now dimly and definitely<span class="redtext">,</span> I do see that <span class="redtext"><s>they might</s></span> well possibly they might have in them something 
        of the character of the period<span class="redtext">,</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them.</span> 
        <br>
        I really do not think so. I think however lively they are or disguised they are<span class="redtext">,</span> they are definitely 
        more comma than period<span class="redtext">,</span> and so really<span class="redtext">,</span> I cannot regret not having used them. 
        They are more powerful<span class="redtext">,</span> more imposing, more pretentious than a comma<span class="redtext">,</span> but they are a comma all the same. 
        They really have within them<span class="redtext">,</span> 
        deeply within them<span class="redtext">,</span> fundamentally within them<span class="redtext">,</span> the comma nature. And now what does a comma do<span class="redtext">, <s>and</s></span>
        what has it to do, and why do I feel as I do about them<span class="redtext">?</span>
