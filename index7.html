                        When I was writing those long sentences of <span class="whitetext">"</span>The Making of Americans<span class="whitetext">"</span>, verbs active 
                        present verbs with long dependent adverbial clauses became a passion with me. 
                        I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions 
                        with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Complications make eventually for simplicity<span class="whitetext">,</span> and therefore<span class="whitetext">,</span> I have always liked 
                        dependent adverbial clauses. I have like<span class="whitetext"><u>d</u></span> dependent adverbial clauses because of their 
                        variety of dependence and independence. You can see how loving the intensity of complication 
                        of these things that commas would be degrading. Why if you want the pleasure of concentrating 
                        on the final simplicity of excessive complication would you want any artificial aid to bring 
                        about that simplicity. Do you see now why I feel about that simplicity<span class="whitetext">?</span> Do you see now why I feel about
                        the comma as I did and as I do<span class="whitetext">?</span>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Think about anything you really like to do and you will see what I mean.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When it gets really difficult you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of 
                        anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool<span class="whitetext">,</span> so anybody 
                        feels who is writing any sentence or reading it after it has been written. And what does a comma do, a comma 
                        does nothing but make easy a thing that if you like it enough is easy enough without the comma. 
                        <br>
                        <span class="largetext">A long complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it and 
                        the comma, well<span class="largetext">,</span> at the most a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath, but if you 
                        want to take a breath you ought to know yourself that you want to take a breath.</span>
                        <br> 
                        It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath<span class="whitetext">,</span> well<span class="whitetext">,</span> you are 
                        always taking a breath and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath. Anyway<span class="whitetext">,</span> that is the way 
                        I felt about it, and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so I almost 
                        never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence<span class="whitetext">,</span> the greater the 
                        number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more<span class="whitetext">,</span> the very 
                        more I had of them<span class="whitetext">,</span> the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves 
                        by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.
                        <br>
                            <br>
                            So<span class="whitetext">,</span> that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose, in poetry it is a little different 
                            but more so<span class="whitetext">,</span>  and later I will go into that. 
                            <br>
                    <span class="largetext">But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.</span>
