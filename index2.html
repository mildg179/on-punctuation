                There are some punctuations that are interesting<span class="redtext">,</span> and there are some punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not. Of these<span class="redtext"><s>, the one but the first and the most</s></span> the completely<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                most uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone<span class="redtext">:</span> when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration<span class="redtext">,</span> but connected with writing it is completely<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                entirely <span class="redtext"><s>completely</s></span> uninteresting. It is evident <span class="redtext">-</span>that is<span class="redtext">-</span> you ask a question<span class="redtext">. <u>Y</u></span>ou ask a question<span class="redtext">,</span> but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question as it is written in writing. 
                Therefore<span class="redtext">,</span> I ask you therefore<span class="redtext">,</span> wherefore<span class="redtext">,</span> should one use the question mark<span class="redtext"><u>?</u></span> Beside it does not in its form go with ordinary printing<span class="redtext">,</span> and so it pleases neither the eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. 
                <br>
                <span class="largetext">A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question<span class="redtext">,</span> and so why add to it the question mark when it is already there when the question is already there in the writing<span class="redtext"><u>?</u></span></span> 
                <br>
                Therefore I never could bring myself to use a question mark, I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, 
                they are unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question what is the use of its being a question<span class="redtext"><u>?</u></span> 
                The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use question marks and quotation marks and exclamation points<span class="redtext">,</span> and now anybody sees it that way. 
                Perhaps some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it that way. 
                <br>
                <br>
                So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation<span class="redtext">. <u>U</u></span>ninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, 
                and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots, and these <span class="redtext"><s>might be interesting</s></span> spaces might be interesting. They might if one felt that way about them.</h2>
