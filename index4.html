                    When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on<span class="redtext">,</span> I still do feel that it should go on, 
                    but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on 
                    and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had periods 
                    to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing 
                    going on<span class="redtext">,</span>  which was at that time<span class="redtext">, <u>(was)</u></span>  
                    the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with 
                    it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had commas to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had periods to do with it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What had periods to do with it<span class="redtext">?</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically 
                    one had to again and again stop sometime<span class="redtext">, <s>and if one had to again and again stop sometime</s></span>  and if one had to again 
                    and again stop some time, then periods had to exist. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="largetext">Beside<span class="redtext">,</span> I had always like the look of periods<span class="redtext">,</span> and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep 
                    one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a 
                    perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods<span class="redtext">,</span> and I used them.</span> 
                    <br>
                    I really never stopped using them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own<span class="redtext">;</span> to commence breaking up 
                    things in arbitrary ways<span class="redtext">. <u>T</u></span>hat has happened lately with me in a poem I have written 
                    called <span class="redtext">"</span>Winning His Way<span class="redtext">"</span>, later I will read you a little of it. 
                    By the time I had written this poem about three years ago<span class="redtext">,</span> periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. 
                    They could begin to act as they thought best, and one might interrupt one’s writing with them 
                    <span class="redtext"><s>that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them</s></span> but one could come to stop<span class="redtext">,</span> arbitrarily 
                    stop<span class="redtext">,</span> at times in one’s writing<span class="redtext">,</span> and so they 
                    could be used and you could use them. Periods could come to exist in this way<span class="redtext">,</span> and they could come in this way to have 
                    a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do. Yes<span class="redtext">,</span> you do feel 
                    what I mean.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Periods have a life of their own<span class="redtext">,</span> a necessity of their own<span class="redtext">. <u>A</u></span> feeling of their own a time of their own. 
                    And that feeling<span class="redtext">,</span> that life<span class="redtext">,</span> that necessity<span class="redtext">,</span> 
                    that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is 
                    the reason that I have always remained true to periods<span class="redtext">,</span> so much so that as I say recently I have felt that 
                    one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
