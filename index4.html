    <p>by Gertrude Stein</p></a>
    <div class="thediv">
        When I first began writing, I felt that writing should go on<span class="redtext">,</span> I still do feel that it should go on, 
        but when I first began writing I was completely possessed by the necessity that writing should go on 
        and on and if writing should go on what had colons and commas to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had periods 
        to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had small letters and capitals to do with it to do with writing 
        going on<span class="redtext">,</span>  which was at that time<span class="redtext">, <u>(was)</u></span>  
        the most profound need I had in connection with writing. What had colons and semi-colons to do with 
        it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had commas to do with it<span class="redtext">? <u>W</u></span>hat had periods to do with it.
        <br>
        <br>
        What had periods to do with it<span class="redtext">?</span> Inevitably no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically 
        one had to again and again stop sometime<span class="redtext">, <s>and if one had to again and again stop sometime</s></span>  and if one had to again 
        and again stop some time, then periods had to exist. 
        <br>
        <span class="largetext">Beside<span class="redtext">,</span> I had always like the look of periods<span class="redtext">,</span> and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep 
        one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a 
        perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods<span class="redtext">,</span> and I used them.</span> 
        <br>
        I really never stopped using them.
        <br>
        <br>
        Beside that periods might later come to have a life of their own<span class="redtext">;</span> to commence breaking up 
        things in arbitrary ways<span class="redtext">. <u>T</u></span>hat has happened lately with me in a poem I have written 
        called <span class="redtext">"</span>Winning His Way<span class="redtext">"</span>, later I will read you a little of it. 
        By the time I had written this poem about three years ago<span class="redtext">,</span> periods had come to have for me completely a life of their own. 
        They could begin to act as they thought best, and one might interrupt one’s writing with them 
        <span class="redtext"><s>that is not really interrupt one’s writing with them</s></span> but one could come to stop<span class="redtext">,</span> arbitrarily 
        stop<span class="redtext">,</span> at times in one’s writing<span class="redtext">,</span> and so they 
        could be used and you could use them. Periods could come to exist in this way<span class="redtext">,</span> and they could come in this way to have 
        a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way as commas and colons and semi-colons do. Yes<span class="redtext">,</span> you do feel 
        what I mean.
        <br>
        <br>
        Periods have a life of their own<span class="redtext">,</span> a necessity of their own<span class="redtext">. <u>A</u></span> feeling of their own a time of their own. 
        And that feeling<span class="redtext">,</span> that life<span class="redtext">,</span> that necessity<span class="redtext">,</span> 
        that time can express itself in an infinite variety that is 
        the reason that I have always remained true to periods<span class="redtext">,</span> so much so that as I say recently I have felt that 
        one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
